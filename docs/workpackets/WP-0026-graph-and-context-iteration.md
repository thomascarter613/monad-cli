# WP-0026: Graph and Context Iteration

## 1. Purpose

Harden project, dependency, task, work packet graphs, context packs, and handoffs.

## 2. Outcome Summary

After this work packet is complete:

- Graphs are useful.
- Context is accurate.
- Handoff is actionable.

## 3. Context

Monad is a Rust CLI for initializing, modifying, evolving, validating, documenting, graphing, governing, and managing serious monorepos.

This work packet follows the WP-0000 standard. It must be understandable by humans and coding-assistant LLMs, and it must provide enough implementation detail to proceed from repo-native planning artifacts.

## 4. Scope

This work packet includes:

- Graph/context hardening

## 5. Non-Goals

This work packet does not include:

- Cloud context sync

## 6. Dependencies

### Required Prior Work

## 13. Command Behavior

Commands affected:

- None.

- Commands follow the approved v1 command contract.
- Mutating commands support `--dry-run`.
- Commands used in CI support machine-readable output where applicable.
- Help output is accurate and tested.

## 14. Data Model / Schema Changes

Data model changes must be documented before implementation.

If this packet adds or changes a schema, update:

- `docs/architecture/`
- `schemas/`
- relevant tests
- generated examples

## 15. Safety Requirements

- Do not write outside the workspace root.
- Do not silently overwrite user-modified files.
- Do not implement post-v1 non-goals.
- Keep changes plan-backed for mutating command behavior once the plan engine exists.
- Preserve `default_scope = "@monad"`.
- Preserve Markdown work packets as canonical.

## 16. Test Requirements

Required tests:

- Unit tests for new core logic.
- Smoke tests for user-visible commands.
- Golden tests for generated output where applicable.
- Error-path tests for invalid inputs.
- Documentation checks for new command behavior.

## 17. Validation Commands

cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
bash scripts/check-docs.sh
```

## 20. Notes for Human Implementers

Implement this packet in order. Keep changes boring, clear, and reviewable. Prefer explicit code and tests over clever abstractions.

## 21. Notes for AI Implementers

- Read WP-0000 before implementing this packet.
- Follow tasks in numeric order.
- Do not implement non-goals.
- Do not silently alter public command signatures.
- Stop and report conflicts with ADRs, earlier packets, or the approved command reference.
- Run validation commands before claiming completion.
- Do not fabricate completion evidence.

## 22. Follow-Up Work

Follow-up work should be captured in later work packets, not added opportunistically to this packet.
